# SoundGrid ðŸŽµ
An interactive sound grid where users can compose simple musical patterns by toggling individual cells in a grid. 

Each row represents a step in time (2 seconds), and each column corresponds to a different musical note. As the playback line moves across the grid, it triggers the notes in the active cells.
